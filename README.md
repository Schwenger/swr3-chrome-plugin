This is a minimalistic extension for Google Chrome. It allows to turn a radio
stream for the German radio station SWR3 on and off with just one click,
conveniently placed in the main tool bar. It contains a visual indicator for the
current state: red for 'off' and green for 'on'.

No fancy features nobody would ever need: This extension focuses on the bare
minimum. And it does it well. Enjoy!
